DEPRECATION WARNING: Initialization autoloaded the constant AlertEmailWorker.

Being able to do this is deprecated. Autoloading during initialization is going
to be an error condition in future versions of Rails.

Reloading does not reboot the application, and therefore code executed during
initialization does not run again. So, if you reload AlertEmailWorker, for example,
the expected changes won't be reflected in that stale Class object.

This autoloaded constant has been unloaded.

In order to autoload safely at boot time, please wrap your code in a reloader
callback this way:

    Rails.application.reloader.to_prepare do
      # Autoload classes and modules needed at boot time here.
    end

That block runs when the application boots, and every time there is a reload.
For historical reasons, it may run twice, so it has to be idempotent.

Check the "Autoloading and Reloading Constants" guide to learn more about how
Rails autoloads and reloads.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Initialization autoloaded the constant AlertEmailWorker.

Being able to do this is deprecated. Autoloading during initialization is going
to be an error condition in future versions of Rails.

Reloading does not reboot the application, and therefore code executed during
initialization does not run again. So, if you reload AlertEmailWorker, for example,
the expected changes won't be reflected in that stale Class object.

This autoloaded constant has been unloaded.

In order to autoload safely at boot time, please wrap your code in a reloader
callback this way:

    Rails.application.reloader.to_prepare do
      # Autoload classes and modules needed at boot time here.
    end

That block runs when the application boots, and every time there is a reload.
For historical reasons, it may run twice, so it has to be idempotent.

Check the "Autoloading and Reloading Constants" guide to learn more about how
Rails autoloads and reloads.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Initialization autoloaded the constant AlertEmailWorker.

Being able to do this is deprecated. Autoloading during initialization is going
to be an error condition in future versions of Rails.

Reloading does not reboot the application, and therefore code executed during
initialization does not run again. So, if you reload AlertEmailWorker, for example,
the expected changes won't be reflected in that stale Class object.

This autoloaded constant has been unloaded.

In order to autoload safely at boot time, please wrap your code in a reloader
callback this way:

      # Autoload classes and modules needed at boot time here.
    end

That block runs when the application boots, and every time there is a reload.

DEPRECATION WARNING: The config.web_console.whitelisted_ips is deprecated and will be ignored in future release of web_console. Please use config.web_console.allowed_ips instead. (called from <top (required)> at /usr/src/app/config/environment.rb:5)
DEPRECATION WARNING: Initialization autoloaded the constant AlertEmailWorker.

Being able to do this is deprecated. Autoloading during initialization is going
to be an error condition in future versions of Rails.

Reloading does not reboot the application, and therefore code executed during
initialization does not run again. So, if you reload AlertEmailWorker, for example,
the expected changes won't be reflected in that stale Class object.

This autoloaded constant has been unloaded.

In order to autoload safely at boot time, please wrap your code in a reloader
callback this way:

    Rails.application.reloader.to_prepare do
      # Autoload classes and modules needed at boot time here.
    end

That block runs when the application boots, and every time there is a reload.
For historical reasons, it may run twice, so it has to be idempotent.

Check the "Autoloading and Reloading Constants" guide to learn more about how
Rails autoloads and reloads.

DEPRECATION WARNING: The config.web_console.whitelisted_ips is deprecated and will be ignored in future release of web_console. Please use config.web_console.allowed_ips instead. (called from <main> at /usr/src/app/config/environment.rb:5)
DEPRECATION WARNING: Initialization autoloaded the constant AlertEmailWorker.

Being able to do this is deprecated. Autoloading during initialization is going
to be an error condition in future versions of Rails.

Reloading does not reboot the application, and therefore code executed during
initialization does not run again. So, if you reload AlertEmailWorker, for example,
the expected changes won't be reflected in that stale Class object.

This autoloaded constant has been unloaded.

In order to autoload safely at boot time, please wrap your code in a reloader
callback this way:

    Rails.application.reloader.to_prepare do
      # Autoload classes and modules needed at boot time here.
    end

That block runs when the application boots, and every time there is a reload.
For historical reasons, it may run twice, so it has to be idempotent.

Check the "Autoloading and Reloading Constants" guide to learn more about how
Rails autoloads and reloads.

DEPRECATION WARNING: The config.web_console.whitelisted_ips is deprecated and will be ignored in future release of web_console. Please use config.web_console.allowed_ips instead. (called from <top (required)> at /usr/src/app/config/environment.rb:5)
DEPRECATION WARNING: Initialization autoloaded the constant AlertEmailWorker.

Being able to do this is deprecated. Autoloading during initialization is going
to be an error condition in future versions of Rails.

Reloading does not reboot the application, and therefore code executed during
initialization does not run again. So, if you reload AlertEmailWorker, for example,
the expected changes won't be reflected in that stale Class object.

This autoloaded constant has been unloaded.

In order to autoload safely at boot time, please wrap your code in a reloader
callback this way:

    Rails.application.reloader.to_prepare do
      # Autoload classes and modules needed at boot time here.
    end

That block runs when the application boots, and every time there is a reload.
For historical reasons, it may run twice, so it has to be idempotent.

Check the "Autoloading and Reloading Constants" guide to learn more about how
Rails autoloads and reloads.

DEPRECATION WARNING: The config.web_console.whitelisted_ips is deprecated and will be ignored in future release of web_console. Please use config.web_console.allowed_ips instead. (called from <top (required)> at /usr/src/app/config/environment.rb:5)
DEPRECATION WARNING: Initialization autoloaded the constant AlertEmailWorker.

Being able to do this is deprecated. Autoloading during initialization is going
to be an error condition in future versions of Rails.

Reloading does not reboot the application, and therefore code executed during
initialization does not run again. So, if you reload AlertEmailWorker, for example,
the expected changes won't be reflected in that stale Class object.

This autoloaded constant has been unloaded.

In order to autoload safely at boot time, please wrap your code in a reloader
callback this way:

    Rails.application.reloader.to_prepare do
      # Autoload classes and modules needed at boot time here.
    end

That block runs when the application boots, and every time there is a reload.
For historical reasons, it may run twice, so it has to be idempotent.

DEPRECATION WARNING: The config.web_console.whitelisted_ips is deprecated and will be ignored in future release of web_console. Please use config.web_console.allowed_ips instead. (called from <top (required)> at /usr/src/app/config/environment.rb:5)
DEPRECATION WARNING: Initialization autoloaded the constant AlertEmailWorker.

Being able to do this is deprecated. Autoloading during initialization is going
to be an error condition in future versions of Rails.

Reloading does not reboot the application, and therefore code executed during
initialization does not run again. So, if you reload AlertEmailWorker, for example,
the expected changes won't be reflected in that stale Class object.

This autoloaded constant has been unloaded.

In order to autoload safely at boot time, please wrap your code in a reloader
callback this way:

    Rails.application.reloader.to_prepare do
      # Autoload classes and modules needed at boot time here.
    end

That block runs when the application boots, and every time there is a reload.
For historical reasons, it may run twice, so it has to be idempotent.

Check the "Autoloading and Reloading Constants" guide to learn more about how
Rails autoloads and reloads.

DEPRECATION WARNING: The config.web_console.whitelisted_ips is deprecated and will be ignored in future release of web_console. Please use config.web_console.allowed_ips instead. (called from <top (required)> at /usr/src/app/config/environment.rb:5)
DEPRECATION WARNING: Initialization autoloaded the constant AlertEmailWorker.

Being able to do this is deprecated. Autoloading during initialization is going
to be an error condition in future versions of Rails.

Reloading does not reboot the application, and therefore code executed during
initialization does not run again. So, if you reload AlertEmailWorker, for example,
the expected changes won't be reflected in that stale Class object.

This autoloaded constant has been unloaded.

In order to autoload safely at boot time, please wrap your code in a reloader
callback this way:

    Rails.application.reloader.to_prepare do
      # Autoload classes and modules needed at boot time here.
    end

That block runs when the application boots, and every time there is a reload.
For historical reasons, it may run twice, so it has to be idempotent.

Check the "Autoloading and Reloading Constants" guide to learn more about how
Rails autoloads and reloads.

DEPRECATION WARNING: The config.web_console.whitelisted_ips is deprecated and will be ignored in future release of web_console. Please use config.web_console.allowed_ips instead. (called from <main> at /usr/src/app/config/environment.rb:5)
DEPRECATION WARNING: Initialization autoloaded the constant AlertEmailWorker.

Being able to do this is deprecated. Autoloading during initialization is going
to be an error condition in future versions of Rails.

Reloading does not reboot the application, and therefore code executed during
initialization does not run again. So, if you reload AlertEmailWorker, for example,
the expected changes won't be reflected in that stale Class object.

This autoloaded constant has been unloaded.

In order to autoload safely at boot time, please wrap your code in a reloader
callback this way:

    Rails.application.reloader.to_prepare do
      # Autoload classes and modules needed at boot time here.
    end

That block runs when the application boots, and every time there is a reload.
For historical reasons, it may run twice, so it has to be idempotent.

Check the "Autoloading and Reloading Constants" guide to learn more about how
Rails autoloads and reloads.

initialization does not run again. So, if you reload AlertEmailWorker, for example,
the expected changes won't be reflected in that stale Class object.

This autoloaded constant has been unloaded.

In order to autoload safely at boot time, please wrap your code in a reloader
callback this way:

    Rails.application.reloader.to_prepare do
      # Autoload classes and modules needed at boot time here.
    end

That block runs when the application boots, and every time there is a reload.
For historical reasons, it may run twice, so it has to be idempotent.
